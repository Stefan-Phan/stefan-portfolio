              I'm a student living in Adelaide, Australia. From a young age,
              I've been deeply fascinated by technology, always believing that
              it has the potential to shape a new and better world. My journey
              into coding began in secondary school, where I was first
              introduced to Pascal. The structured logic and the way I could
              communicate with a machine through code immediately captured my
              interest. It was as if I had discovered a new language, one that
              allowed me to bring ideas to life through the screen. <br />
              <br /> As I progressed through school, my passion for coding only
              grew stronger. I found myself drawn to the problem-solving aspect,
              the thrill of debugging, and the satisfaction of seeing a program
              run successfully. However, it wasn't until I took a half-year gap
              to explore different interests that I truly understood how much
              coding meant to me. During this time, I dabbled in various fields,
              from design to mathematics, but nothing resonated with me as much
              as the world of coding did. <br />
              <br /> This period of exploration solidified my love for
              technology and the art of programming. I began to dive deeper into
              different languages and frameworks, learning everything I
              couldâ€”from the intricacies of algorithms to the principles of
              software development. Each new concept I mastered felt like
              unlocking another level in a vast, complex game. What I love most
              about coding is its limitless potential. It's not just about
              writing lines of code; it's about creating solutions, innovating,
              and constantly learning. I'm excited to continue my journey in the
              tech world, eager to see how I can contribute to shaping the
              future through the power of code.
